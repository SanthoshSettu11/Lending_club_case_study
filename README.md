This case study aims to explore how Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be used to identify patterns that predict loan defaults.
Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

Business Understanding

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:  
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.



EDA Techniques used
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
Data Transformation: Convert categorical data into numerical format, normalize data.
Visualization: Use histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between variables.
